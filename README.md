Things that I learned.
    1. In the Theme.of(Context).textTheme, we have a few deprecated members.Here is a list:
		headline1: headline1 ?? display4 ?? this.headline1,
    		headline2: headline2 ?? display3 ?? this.headline2,
    		headline3: headline3 ?? display2 ?? this.headline3,
    		headline4: headline4 ?? display1 ?? this.headline4,
    		headline5: headline5 ?? headline ?? this.headline5,
    		headline6: headline6 ?? title ?? this.headline6,
    		subtitle1: subtitle1 ?? subhead ?? this.subtitle1,
    		subtitle2: subtitle2 ?? subtitle ?? this.subtitle2,
    		bodyText1: bodyText1 ?? body2 ?? this.bodyText1,
    		bodyText2: bodyText2 ?? body1 ?? this.bodyText2,
    		caption: caption ?? this.caption,
    		button: button ?? this.button,
    		overline: overline ?? this.overline,
	
	2. I am adding a way to capture things that I would need to look up. I have a new folder called App Shortcuts. 

	3. Error Message: command phasescriptexecution failed with a nonzero exit code flutter
		We did a flutter upgrade and it broke something. We tried the pod init and install. 

		We went through a lot of troubleshooting. We found that upgrading the flutter_svg to last version fixed the issue. 
		
		Here is somethings that we tried and error logs. 
		Used for diagnostics
		> cd ios
		> xcrun xcodebuild -configuration Debug -showBuildSettings -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner
